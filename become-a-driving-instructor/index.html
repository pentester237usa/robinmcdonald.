From start to finish, the training process was incredibly smooth and rewarding, thanks to the commitment, flexibility, and expertise of the team.

A special mention goes to Barry Moffatt, who trained me for Part 3 of the ADI process. Barry’s wealth of knowledge and experience really stood out, and he ensured I passed first time. He was always good craic, making the lessons enjoyable and something to look forward to. His approach to training was not only professional but also very personable, and he was always available for advice both during and outside of our scheduled lessons. This made the entire experience far less stressful and much more engaging.<p></p>

I also want to thank Robin McDonald, who played a crucial role in my training alongside Barry. Robin’s guidance and support were invaluable, and the personalised approach they offer as a team made a world of difference in my preparation.<p></p>

Overall, A+ Driving Academy is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to pursue their ADI qualification. Their commitment to high-quality, flexible training, coupled with their deep understanding of what trainees need, ensures that you’ll receive top-notch instruction every step of the way. I couldn’t recommend them highly enough!<p></p>

After passing part 1 Robin put me in contact with Andy Watson for my part 2 training , Andy’s knowledge and training was first class and with this I passed my part 2 first time I would like to thank Andy for all his help and support. After this then it was time for the Part 3 and was in contact with Barry & Kathryn from A+ I really enjoyed my training sessions with them they were always full of support and encouragement and with all there guidance and training I passed my part 3 first time they both are fantastic trainers and I would I would like to thank them both.

I first thought about a career change to becoming a Driving Instructor in 2008 but due to other circumstances it never developed. However, in 2018, after many years in an Engineering/Manufacturing background, I made the decision to become a Driving Instructor. 
Initially I went with a well known driving school in Belfast and completed parts 1 & 2. I had my first attempt at part 3 and failed. I was told that if I had been teaching learners it would have been a different outcome. Unfortunately, this would have meant me teaching learners in Belfast which wasn't an ideal situation. 
When scrolling through Facebook one day I noticed an advertisement from Robin McDonald looking for new driving instructors. I contacted Robin and it wasn't long before I was teaching! 
I then proceeded to undertake my part 3 training with John and Robin. Their training methods, attitude, approach and knowledge were second to none and, over time I grew in confidence. It was hard work and required dedication and commitment on my part but, as time went on, it all made sense. I had a second attempt at the part 3 and passed! I was over the moon! There is no doubt in my mind that the total package of teaching learners with the specific teaching tools provided by Robin and his team, was the catalyst for my success! If you are thinking about a career change I would highly recommend that you contact Robin at A+ Driving Academy.</p></div></div>				</div>

From the outset Kathryn was amazing. She made it very clear that if I wanted to pass part 3 I would need to put in alot of work in both with her and with studying at home...<br><br>
From our first lesson together it was very clear that Kathryn was very knowledgeable in regards to  what part 3 and the training required. She made me feel very comfortable and always gave me advice and feedback throughout each lesson. Kathryn was always available through text, calls etc and was a fantastic help through the months of hard training leading up to the test. Kathryn was always very positive throughout and gave me lots of encouragement and made me feel that together we could pass the exam.<br><br>


Barry stood in for Kathryn and was a massive help as well. Again his knowledge around the part 3 training was obvious and he to played a massive role in me passing the exam. He put me through my paces carrying out a mock test the week before, giving me feedback and advice which I was able to carry forward into the test.<br><br>


I would just like to take the time to thank both Kathryn and Barry for their help and support throughout my training. Both were amazing and such a help...without the training they both provided I would have struggled but thanks to them I was able to pass first time. So thanks to them both for their support, advice and encouragement.<br><br>


I'd like to thank A+ for taking me onboard and giving me the chance to change my career to something that suited my family life...they have been great.

I completed my part 2 in Belfast with another driving school but when it came to part 3 the instructor seemed very unsure of what he was doing. I spoke to a few people I worked with who where also training to be driving instructors and they recommended I use Robin. I learned so much from Robin and found that with every lesson I gained more and more information and I improved week on week. I can't recommend Robin enough, he is very knowledgeable in every aspect of his job and not only got me through my part 3 but put me in touch with the right people in order to start my own business.</p></div></div>				</div>

<br><br>
I spoke with one of my friends who had passed their part 3 test with Robin as their trainer and decided that a change of trainer was required. I contacted Robin and knew from the first phone call that I was making the right decision. Robin immediately gave me the confidence and put the fun factor back into learning. 
<br><br>
All of Robin's lessons were well structured and prepared me for my final attempt at my test. Robin showed me were I was going wrong and ironed out any issues that i had. The results speak for themselves 5/6. If you have a desire to becoming a driving instructor, then make the right decision and contact Robin for your training.</p></div></div>				</div>

But that is where the dream ended. After failing my first attempt at part 3 with a very poor score, I quickly realised that the training i was receiving for this the most difficult of the three exams was grossly inadequate and because I didn't have any pupils to help me train I knew there was no way i'd ever pass with this level of instruction. By coincidence I met a friend i hadn't seen in years, we both got talking and it turned out he had also became a driving instructor and had just qualified as an ADI, he went on to tell me that he had the same problem as myself with his previous instructor, he then informed me that I should contact Robin McDonald as he was the man responsible for getting him through his part three very quickly, and he couldn't praise Robin enough. His actual words to me were "after the first lesson you'll know you made the right decision." And how very true his words were. After the lesson I told my wife that I would pass on my next attempt. After approximately four months of excellent, calm, encouraging and extremely informative tuition with Robin McDonald i passed my part three test with excellent grades. To reach this level compared to what I got before was an amazing transformation and was due to the training I received from this expertly skilled trainer who prepared me to a very high standard enabling me to cope with anything the examiner might test me on. I can only thank Robin for getting me passed and for the high level of knowledge he imparted to me.</p></div></div>				</div>

When I inquired from local driving instructors that I knew, who would be the best person to go to, for driving instructor training there was only one answer. Robin mc Donald.
               
From my first phone call to Robin, I knew I was speaking to the best man for the job. He explained in easy to understand detail exactly what was involved to become a driving instructor. From the part 1 up to the final part 3. Once I had passed my part 1 I started my part 2 and 3 training with Robin. From the first lesson Robin was informative and knowledgeable about every aspect of the training, and came across very professional and friendly. So, by the time I was ready for my tests every eventually was covered. Since passing my tests I now work for A+Driving Academy as a driving instructor.
