										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>About the Hazard Perception Test</strong></span></p>
<p>&#8211; The test consists of 14 video clips.<br />
&#8211; It is the second part of the DVSA Theory Test. To pass the theory test, you must pass both sections (multiple choice and hazard perception) on the same test.<br />
&#8211; Each clip is about one minute long.<br />
&#8211; The hazard perception test will last for about twenty minutes.<br />
&#8211; The clips show real life driving scenarios and are shot from a car as if from the driver&#8217;s point of view.<br />
&#8211; There is at least one hazard in each clip. One clip has two hazards. You will not be told which clip has two hazards.<br />
&#8211; A hazard is something that will cause the driver to react in a way that impedes their progress.<br />
&#8211; When you identify the hazard on screen, you need to click the mouse. The earlier you identify the hazard, the more points you will score for your click. The timer counts down from five to zero points.<br />
&#8211; Although you may click several times on a clip because you may believe there is more than one hazard, clicking continuously will result in you scoring zero.<br />
&#8211; In a clip you may see several potential hazards. They only become a hazard if they would force the driver of the vehicle to change speed, direction or stop. These are the hazards you must click for.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Definition of A Hazard</span></strong></p>
<p>A hazard can be anything that causes a driver to change the speed, direction or stop the vehicle they are driving. Although in real life a hazard may be static such as a set of traffic lights, a junction or a bend, these are not the sorts of hazards that you will need to identify during the hazard perception test. During the hazard perception test you will need to identify hazards that develop and thus have motion such as a bus pulling away from a bus stop or a lollypop lady stepping into the road.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Potential Hazards</strong></span></p>
<p>These are situations that could lead to a hazard but haven&#8217;t impacted the driver in any way. If you click at this point, you won&#8217;t score any points.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Developing Hazards</strong></span></p>
<p>This is when the hazard seems like it will definitely affect the driver. This is when the scoring window opens and when you should click.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Actual Hazard</span></strong></p>
<p>This is when the scoring window closes. The developing hazard is now a hazard and should have been identified prior to this stage.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Passing the Hazard Perception Test</strong></span></p>
<p>To pass the Hazard Perception Test, you must score a minimum of 44 out of 75 points.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div></div>
<hr class="styled-hr" />
<div></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">The Hazard Perception test forms the second section of the theory test. For cars and motorcycles, this test must be passed at the same time as the multiple choice part. For LGV and PCV theory tests (bus and lorry), they are taken as two separate tests. You must pass both.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div class="paragraph">At the start of the hazard perception test, you will be shown a demonstration as to how the test works.<br />
You will then be shown 14 clips of everyday road scenes (19 for LGV and PCV). You will be asked to identify at least 1 developing hazard in each clip. One clip will have 2 developing hazards. This clip won&#8217;t be identified during the test.</p>
<p>The DVSA describe a developing hazard as &#8216;something that may result in you having to take some action, such as changing speed or direction.&#8217; The earlier you spot the developing hazard, the higher your score will be.</p>
<p>The maximum points you can score for each hazard is 5. It can be difficult to identify developing hazards, and therefore when the scoring window should start. This is why it is safer to click a few times as you see a hazard develop. This way, you can be sure you do not click too early and miss the opening of the scoring window.<br />
​<br />
It is possible to score zero on a clip for clicking too much, or with a regular pattern. Don&#8217;t let this put you off, if you see what you believe to be a developing hazard, then click the button.</p>
</div>

<div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none "><a href="https://test.1driver.co.uk/hazard-preception-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="http://www.1driver.co.uk/uploads/3/8/6/2/3862120/hazard-perception-mock-test-online_orig.png" alt="hazard perception mock test online" /></a></p>
<div></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wsite-spacer"></div>
<div class="paragraph">Recognition of available clues and a perception of danger are the skills that are necessary for all drivers and riders, irrespective of the vehicle used. For this reason, the same version of the hazard perception test is used for cars and motorcycles. LGV and PCV hazard perception tests consist of 19 clips and a higher pass mark.</p>
<p><u>Look out for these hazards</u><br />
&#8211; Hidden junctions and turns.<br />
&#8211; Pedestrians or cyclists crossing the road.<br />
&#8211; Vehicles emerging from side roads, parking places, or driveways.<br />
&#8211; Large vehicles crossing over to your side of the road.<br />
&#8211; Narrow roads where meeting other vehicles can be troublesome.<br />
&#8211; Loose pets and farmyard animals.<br />
&#8211; Changes in the traffic movement and volume because of temporary obstructions, such as broken down vehicles and road works.<br />
&#8211; Junctions and roundabouts.<br />
&#8211; Horse riders.<br />
&#8211; Adverse weather conditions.<br />
&#8211; Road surfaces.<br />
&#8211; Parked vehicles.</p>
<p>If you would check your mirror or brake when you see a potential hazard, this is a good indication that you should click the mouse.<br />
​<br />
You won&#8217;t be able to review your answers on this section of the theory test.<br />
The maximum score for the car and motorcycle theory test is 75 (i.e. 15 hazards x 5). The pass mark for this part of the test is 44 out of 75.<br />
Those taking LGV or PCV tests must score at least 67 out of 100 (i.e. 20 hazards x 5).</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ugh, the theory test. As if preparing for the <a title="How to pass your driving test" href="https://www.ingenie.com/young-drivers-guide/how-to-pass-your-driving-test-2/">practical driving test</a> wasn’t pressure enough, you’ll also need to pass the theory test before you can get your full driving licence. To help you achieve top marks, we’ve got 10 top tips for success.</p>
<h2>Be prepared:</h2>
<ol class="numbered-large">
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ol class="numbered-large">
<li>
<h3>Book your theory test</h3>
<p>It may sound obvious, but you’ll need to book your theory test at one of the 160 test centres nationwide. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-theory-test-centre" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visit the official government site</a> to find your nearest centre and book your test.</p>
<blockquote><p>Make sure you have your provisional licence and a credit or debit card to hand, because it’ll cost around £30.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Hit the books</h3>
<div class="row row-fluid">
<div class="col-10-12">
<p class="margin-right-20">During the theory test you’ll be given <strong>50 multiple choice questions</strong> from a bank of more than 1000 and you’ll need to get at least 43 correct to pass.</p>
<p class="margin-right-20">The good news is that the DVSA (Driving Standards Agency) has produced a theory test handbook which is packed full of useful tips and example questions. Make sure you get your hands on a copy and take some time to revise.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-2-12"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.ingenie.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/08/Hit-the-books-circle1.jpg" alt="Hit the books" width="300" height="300" /></div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Brush up on your hazard spotting</h3>
<p>Once you’ve made it through the multiple-choice questions you’ll move on to the hazard perception test. It’s made up of a series of video clips featuring a variety of driving hazards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right"><strong>Driving Standards Agency (DVSA)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Put in the hours</h3>
<p>Yep, when it comes to revising there’s just no substitute for putting the hours in. Your theory test questions will be picked at random, so you need to be confident answering ANY of the questions in the DSA Theory Test Handbook &#8211; that’s around 1000 possible questions!</p>
<p>And don’t forget to practise your hazard perception. You need to get <strong>a minimum of 43 out of 50</strong> on the multiple choice and <strong>44 out of 75</strong> on the hazard perception test to pass.</p>
<p>Practise answering under pressure by asking friends and family to quiz you, bearing in mind that in the real test you’ll have 57 minutes to answer the 50 questions.</li>
<li>
<h3>Take a mock test</h3>
<div class="row row-fluid">
<div class="col-10-12">
<p class="margin-right-20">Think you’re ready for your theory test? Head over to the government-run <a href="http://www.safedrivingforlife.info/practicetheorytest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safe Driving for Life website</a> and try their mock tests &#8211; though they only offer the multiple choice part.</p>
<p class="margin-right-20">If your mock test doesn’t go quite as well as you hoped, you can reschedule your theory test <strong>up to 3 days</strong> before your test date. If you’re not feeling confident of a pass, it’s best to take a rain check and squeeze in some extra revision!</p>
</div>

</div>
<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re worried about hazard perception, get an app that lets you practise.</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>On the day:</h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>Top tip: </strong>You need to be at the test centre 30 minutes before the start of your test.</p></blockquote>
<ol class="numbered-large">
<li>
<h3>Leave plenty of time</h3>
<p>Chances are you’ve not been to the theory test centre before, so leave plenty of time to get there and minimise stress on the day.</li>
<li>
<h3>Don&#8217;t forget your provisional licence photocard</h3>
<div class="row row-fluid">
<div class="col-10-12">
<p class="margin-right-20">You must have your photocard driving licence on the day of your theory test. If you forget it, you won’t be able to sit your test and you’ll still have to pay the test fee.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-2-12"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.ingenie.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/08/Provisional-license-circle1.jpg" alt="Provisional Licence" width="300" height="300" /></div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Use the practice time</h3>
<p>You get <strong>15 minutes</strong> before your test to get used to the touch screen and the layout of the questions. Take your time and if something doesn’t look like it’s working properly, raise it before your test starts.</li>
<li>
<h3>Flag tricky questions</h3>
<p>In the test you’ll have <strong>57 minutes</strong> to answer <strong>50 multiple choice questions</strong>. Stuck on a tricky one? Not to worry. Hit the flag button and it’ll mark the question as unanswered, so you can easily go back to it before the end of the test.</li>
<li>
<h3>Take a breather</h3>
<div class="row row-fluid">
<div class="col-10-12">
<p class="margin-right-20">You get a <strong>3 minute break</strong> between the first and second part of your test. You’re halfway there (YES!) so take a breather, have a quick stretch at the desk and focus on the next part of the test &#8211; <a title="What to expect from the hazard perception test" href="https://www.ingenie.com/young-drivers-guide/what-to-expect-from-the-hazard-perception-test/#.VIV319ysXFk" target="">hazard perception</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To be a safe driver, you need to know the rules of the road, and that’s where the driving theory test comes in.</p>
<p>The test is divided into two parts &#8211; multiple choice and hazard perception. Both tests are usually completed on a computer at the test station.</p>
<p>The multiple choice section consists of 50 questions, which you have 57 minutes to complete. You’ll need 43 or more correct answers to pass.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll then have the option of taking a short break before starting the hazard perception test.</p>
<p>This section involves watching 14 video clips which feature “everyday road scenes”, with at least one developing hazard.</p>
<p>TOP TIP &#8211; one of the clips will feature two developing hazards rather than one, so watch out for that one.</p>
<p>You need to click the mouse whenever you see a hazard developing. Each hazard carries a maximum score of five, and you’ll gain more points for spotting hazards earlier.</p>
<p>The pass mark for the hazard perception test is 44 of a possible 75.</p>
