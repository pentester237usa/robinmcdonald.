<p>Take this opportunity to BREATHE,  just think of the examiner as your own driving instructor asking the very same questions.</p>
<p>I have attached a video from the DVSA guide on these. I find watching a video can help the memory recall, hope it helps you all too.</p>

<p>It’s also wise to get a mechanic to give your car an MOT check and make sure he checks the headlights for alignment too.</p>
<p>Make sure your horn is working and fog lamp plus your fog lamp switch that needs to be illuminated.</p>
<p>Check that you have no warning lights on your dash, especially an ABS light<br />
And finally try all your seat belts that they lock when pulled hard and retract properly.</p>

<h2>Why do we have roundabouts?</h2>
<p>When two, or more, busy roads intersect – something has to give.</p>
<p>Roundabouts are designed to keep traffic moving, ease congestion and speed up journey times.</p>
<p>They’re also safer than traditional junctions and crossroads – where drivers can be tempted to run red lights. On roundabouts traffic always travels in the same direction, making manoeuvres like right turns far easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How do roundabouts work?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/images/uploads/panel-images/Roundabouts_-_how_to_use.jpg" alt="Roundabouts" /></p>
<p>The approaching traffic usually gives way to traffic already on the roundabout, which always comes from the right.</p>
<p>By waiting for a safe gap – you can join the flow of traffic and continue in the correct lane until reaching your exit.</p>
<p>Ensure that you signal before you leave the roundabout. You would usually signal as you pass the exit just before the one you need.</p>
<p>It’s also possible and recommended to use a roundabout to perform a U-turn. This is the safest option.</p>
<p>Like regular roads, larger roundabouts consist of different lanes. Only by joining a roundabout in the correct lane will you be able to access your chosen exit.</p>
<p>A typical roundabout has three or four exits, although in some cases there can be as many as seven, or as few as two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Approaching a roundabout and picking the correct lane</h3>
<p>You’ll know you’re approaching a roundabout when you see a red triangle warning sign with a black circular emblem inside. However not all roundabouts are signposted.</p>
<p>Mini-roundabouts, will usually be flanked with a blue circle sign with three white circular arrows inside.</p>
</div>
</div>

<li><img decoding="async" src="https://d1ix0byejyn2u7.cloudfront.net/drive/images/uploads/panel-images/ws_cropper/4_5x0_784x523_794x530_mini_roundabouts.jpg" alt="Mini roundabout sign" /></li>
</ul>
<ul class="pagination">
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li class="page item-2 last">Mini roundabouts work in the same way as larger ones, but often appear in narrower residential areas.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section section__wygwam">
<div class="wygwam">
<p>Once you’ve identified a roundabout ahead, it’s time to start making your preparations and crucially select the correct lane.</p>
<p>Road markings in the form of arrows (and often text), work together with road signs on the roundabout approach to indicate which lanes go where on each specific roundabout.</p>
<p>But you’ll soon get into the habit of selecting the lane you’ll need, and in some cases you’ll even have a choice.</p>
<p>Once you’ve reached the roundabout and decided whether you need to stop or whether you can continue if the road is clear then select the correct gear.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to acknowledge the golden rule of roundabouts:</p>
<p><strong>Give way to traffic coming from the right.</strong></p>
<p>Ensure you’re signalling in the direction you want to take before entering the roundabout, unless you’re travelling straight on, in which case you don’t need to signal until you pass the exit before the one you are going to use.</p>
<p>If the roundabout has standing traffic, you can only join it if you will not block any entrances or exits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Turning left</h3>
<p>If you’re taking a left turn at a roundabout (usually the 1st exit), you’ll always need to approach it in the left lane.</p>
<p>Ensure you remain in the left-hand lane for the entire time you’re on the roundabout. Keep your left indicator on and leave via the first exit.</p>
<h3>Continuing straight ahead</h3>
<p>Often, you, just want to travel straight on through the roundabout, sometimes people will say: &#8216;head straight over the roundabout&#8217;.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of the roundabout, you’ll often be able to use the left-hand lane for this, but in some cases the left-hand lane will be for left turns only (signs will guide you on this).</p>
<p>There are also instances where larger roundabouts, have a designated lane for driving straight over. Check the road markings on approach.</p>
<p>Just after the first exit, check your main mirror, then your left door mirror. Signal left and if all is clear, take your exit.</p>
<h3>Turning right</h3>
<p>If you’re taking a right turn at a roundabout, (typically the 3rd exit), you’ll need to travel around it from the right-hand lane.</p>
<p>Continue in the right-hand lane until you pass the 2nd exit. Check your main mirror, then your left door mirror and signal left.</p>
<p>You’ll need to move into the left lane before exiting – so check your blind spot while doing this with a quick glance over your left shoulder. Once in the left lane you’re ready to exit.</p>

<h2>How could I fail my test at a roundabout?</h2>
<p>Here we take a look at potential mistakes you could make on your driving test and whether they will constitute a fail or not.</p>
<p>You can have up to 15 driver faults but just one serious fault means a fail.</p>
<h3>Hesitating at a roundabout</h3>
<p>Of course you won’t be penalised for ‘not taking a chance’, and nobody wants you to take risks, but if you miss a clear-cut, safe opportunity to join a roundabout, you’ll be holding up traffic for no good reason.</p>
<p>A short delay may be marked as a driver fault. If you miss a clear opportunity where there was plenty of time to proceed you may fail the test as a serious fault could be marked.</p>
<p>If it’s clear early on that you’re fine to continue, do so without stopping completely – which could cause a rear-end collision</p>
<h3>Failure to safely address a wrong lane choice</h3>
<p>You won’t fail your test for choosing the wrong lane – it’s all about how you react. Use mirrors, checks, speed and signals to get back on track and you’ll be fine.</p>
<h3>Driving straight over the centre of a mini-roundabout</h3>
<p>While clipping the painted, or raised centre is unlikely to result in a failure, blatantly driving over it will.</p>
<h3>Failure to signal</h3>
<p>Particularly if cutting across lanes to exit on a right turn, you’ll be heavily penalised for not signalling as this is a very risky manoeuvre.</p>
<h3>Forgetting to cancel the indicator after exiting</h3>
<p>If you leave your signal on for too long it will confuse other road users. Whether this is classed a driver fault or a serious fault will depend on how long it is before you notice!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you are new to driving?&#8230;at Aplus Driving Academy we want you to be safe and enjoy your newly acquired skills. We all know these days we have to be adaptable and multitasking is at the forefront of how we are today. However, this does not apply to your attention span in a vehicle&#8230;.. Here are a few things you need to remember:</p>

<p>Dealing with distractions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you need to do something distracting, find a safe place to pull over</li>
<li>Recognise what makes you distracted, then work out whether or not you really need to do it</li>
<li>Make sure you’re ready to drive before setting off. After an emotional event, you might need to take some time to calm down</li>
<li>Use technology sensibly – or not at all</li>
<li>Plan your route in advance so you’re not having to work out your route as you go along.</li>
</ul>
<p>These simple steps can and do avoid collisions.</p>
<p><strong>How frustrating are all these things? We all see examples of this every day&#8230;.let&#8217;s just not be one of them. </strong></p>

<h3>Winter car equipment</h3>
<p>Carrying an emergency kit with you at all times through the winter might seem a bit extreme – but if you ever find yourself stranded you’ll be glad of it. We recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>• A mobile phone and charger</strong></li>
<li><strong>• A hazard warning triangle</strong></li>
<li><strong>• Hi-visibility vest</strong></li>
<li><strong>• A first aid kit</strong></li>
<li><strong>• De-icer and a scraper</strong></li>
<li><strong>• A shovel</strong></li>
<li><strong>• A tow rope</strong></li>
<li><strong>• Wellington boots</strong></li>
<li><strong>• A torch</strong></li>
<li><strong>• Warm clothes</strong></li>
<li><strong>• Food and drink</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And a decent set of car mats will not only protect your car’s carpets from wet or muddy feet, but can be wedged under the driven wheels to get you moving should you get really stuck in the snow.</p>

<h3>Check your car battery</h3>
<p>Cold and damp weather can put a strain on your car&#8217;s 12-volt battery. Cold weather makes it harder for an engine to turn over, but unfortunately, as an EV driver will tell you, cold weather also has a negative impact on the power a battery can deliver. If you haven&#8217;t changed your car battery recently, then it could be tired, and the cold weather means it might not play ball. Add in the additional power drain of heaters and other electrical devices, and it can become a critical component. If the battery struggles to provide enough power to start your car, the chances are it&#8217;s on its way out.</p>
<p>You can get a home battery tester, but it’s easier to see a specialist. Assuming you can start the car, you can drive to your local dealer or car spares shop to buy a new one. Most car battery stockists will even fit it for you.</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/accessories-tyres/winter-special/89304/how-to-jump-start-your-car">How to jump-start a car</a></p>
<p>Car battery prices vary, and can cost from around £60 fitted, although models fitted with stop-start systems need a heavier duty battery that can cost more than £100, depending on the size, type and the electrical current produced. There are dozens of combinations on offer, so make sure you get the correct one for your car.</p>
</div>
<p>If you can’t start your car, but have access to a 12-volt power supply in another car, then you can use a set of jump leads. If you&#8217;re skilled enough and it&#8217;s accessible, you could remove the battery and charge it indoors. This can be complex, not least because car batteries are heavy. You should always refer to the owner’s manual.</p>
<h3>Check antifreeze</h3>
<p>Antifreeze, as its name suggests, stops the water in the engine’s cooling system from freezing. To test the effectiveness of your antifreeze, an antifreeze tester is available for about £5. To use it, unscrew the coolant reservoir cap under the bonnet (ensuring the engine is cold first), lower the tube into the coolant and squeeze the rubber bulb on the end to suck some antifreeze inside the tester.</p>
<p>You can then read the freezing point of the antifreeze using the scale inside the tester. Replace the antifreeze in the car’s system and replace the cap.</p>
<h3>Check screen wash</h3>
<p>Winter weather is frequently wet, and this draws all the dirt and road salt from the road surface, so you’ll spend lots of time using your windscreen wipers. Assuming your wipers are in good shape, there’s still a high risk of them smearing grime across the windscreen if your screen wash bottle is empty.</p>
<div id="file-66018" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-narrow">
<div class="content"><img decoding="async" title="The best screen wash" src="https://cdn1.autoexpress.co.uk/sites/autoexpressuk/files/styles/insert_main_image/public/images/car_photo_524326.jpg?itok=4-09HnOl" alt="The best screen wash" /></div>
</div>
<p>To ensure this doesn’t happen to you, open the windscreen washer bottle under the bonnet, and fill it with screen wash. You can buy ready mixed or concentrated screen wash, which you’ll need to mix with water.</p>
<p>Screen wash has a lower freezing temperature than water alone, so you shouldn’t end up with frozen washer jets, although they can still become blocked if there&#8217;s a particularly heavy frost or freezing rain gets into them.</p>
<h3>Check exterior lights</h3>
<p>It sounds simple, and it is. The days are shorter and the weather is worse during the winter months, so maintenance of your exterior lights an important aspect of any winter car checklist.</p>
<p>Check and clean your lights regularly. The salt and dirt can quickly build-up, reducing the effectiveness of the lights and reducing your visibility to other road users. It&#8217;s best to keep your lights on in all sorts of weather, as it helps you to be seen. Carry extra bulbs in case of a failure, but do try and learn how to replace the bulbs when it&#8217;s convenient, because you can guarantee that when one blows it&#8217;ll be in the dark, in freezing cold and possibly wet weather, which isn&#8217;t an ideal time to learn about your car.</p>
<h3>Professional winter car checks</h3>
<p>If you’ve not got the time to prepare your car for winter, then you can ask an expert to do it for you. Many main dealers and high street car spares shops can do this for a nominal fee. Some even offer free winter car checks, especially if your car is due a service around the same time.</p>
<h3>Winter tyres</h3>
<p>If you frequently drive in winter, then consider buying a set of <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/accessories-tyres/66645/winter-tyres-test-reviews-and-prices-for-2014-2015">winter tyres</a>. They offer exceptional grip when the temperature drops below seven degrees, and while they&#8217;re effective in snow and ice, they also perform better than summer tyres when it&#8217;s wet. They’re not cheap, but are well worth the investment for the additional safety they bring.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s up to you whether you buy a second set of wheels to fit them on, but if you choose to swap the winter tyres onto the same wheels, it&#8217;s a job for a tyre fitter, as it&#8217;s a pretty tough job to do yourself.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t want the extra cost of winter tyres, checking the tread depth of your existing tyres is important. The legal limit is 1.6mm, but having more than this can dramatically improve steering and braking &#8211; if your tyres are due replacing, then winter is a good time to do it. Also check your tyre pressures regularly, as these can change with the drop in air temperature with the changing of the seasons.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>About the Hazard Perception Test</strong></span></p>
<p>&#8211; The test consists of 14 video clips.<br />
&#8211; It is the second part of the DVSA Theory Test. To pass the theory test, you must pass both sections (multiple choice and hazard perception) on the same test.<br />
&#8211; Each clip is about one minute long.<br />
&#8211; The hazard perception test will last for about twenty minutes.<br />
&#8211; The clips show real life driving scenarios and are shot from a car as if from the driver&#8217;s point of view.<br />
&#8211; There is at least one hazard in each clip. One clip has two hazards. You will not be told which clip has two hazards.<br />
&#8211; A hazard is something that will cause the driver to react in a way that impedes their progress.<br />
&#8211; When you identify the hazard on screen, you need to click the mouse. The earlier you identify the hazard, the more points you will score for your click. The timer counts down from five to zero points.<br />
&#8211; Although you may click several times on a clip because you may believe there is more than one hazard, clicking continuously will result in you scoring zero.<br />
&#8211; In a clip you may see several potential hazards. They only become a hazard if they would force the driver of the vehicle to change speed, direction or stop. These are the hazards you must click for.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Definition of A Hazard</span></strong></p>
<p>A hazard can be anything that causes a driver to change the speed, direction or stop the vehicle they are driving. Although in real life a hazard may be static such as a set of traffic lights, a junction or a bend, these are not the sorts of hazards that you will need to identify during the hazard perception test. During the hazard perception test you will need to identify hazards that develop and thus have motion such as a bus pulling away from a bus stop or a lollypop lady stepping into the road.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Potential Hazards</strong></span></p>
<p>These are situations that could lead to a hazard but haven&#8217;t impacted the driver in any way. If you click at this point, you won&#8217;t score any points.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Developing Hazards</strong></span></p>
<p>This is when the hazard seems like it will definitely affect the driver. This is when the scoring window opens and when you should click.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Actual Hazard</span></strong></p>
<p>This is when the scoring window closes. The developing hazard is now a hazard and should have been identified prior to this stage.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Passing the Hazard Perception Test</strong></span></p>
<p>To pass the Hazard Perception Test, you must score a minimum of 44 out of 75 points.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div></div>
<hr class="styled-hr" />
<div></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">The Hazard Perception test forms the second section of the theory test. For cars and motorcycles, this test must be passed at the same time as the multiple choice part. For LGV and PCV theory tests (bus and lorry), they are taken as two separate tests. You must pass both.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div class="paragraph">At the start of the hazard perception test, you will be shown a demonstration as to how the test works.<br />
You will then be shown 14 clips of everyday road scenes (19 for LGV and PCV). You will be asked to identify at least 1 developing hazard in each clip. One clip will have 2 developing hazards. This clip won&#8217;t be identified during the test.</p>
<p>The DVSA describe a developing hazard as &#8216;something that may result in you having to take some action, such as changing speed or direction.&#8217; The earlier you spot the developing hazard, the higher your score will be.</p>
<p>The maximum points you can score for each hazard is 5. It can be difficult to identify developing hazards, and therefore when the scoring window should start. This is why it is safer to click a few times as you see a hazard develop. This way, you can be sure you do not click too early and miss the opening of the scoring window.<br />
​<br />
It is possible to score zero on a clip for clicking too much, or with a regular pattern. Don&#8217;t let this put you off, if you see what you believe to be a developing hazard, then click the button.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none "><a href="https://test.1driver.co.uk/hazard-preception-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" src="http://www.1driver.co.uk/uploads/3/8/6/2/3862120/hazard-perception-mock-test-online_orig.png" alt="hazard perception mock test online" /></a></p>
<div></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wsite-spacer"></div>
<div class="paragraph">Recognition of available clues and a perception of danger are the skills that are necessary for all drivers and riders, irrespective of the vehicle used. For this reason, the same version of the hazard perception test is used for cars and motorcycles. LGV and PCV hazard perception tests consist of 19 clips and a higher pass mark.</p>
<p><u>Look out for these hazards</u><br />
&#8211; Hidden junctions and turns.<br />
&#8211; Pedestrians or cyclists crossing the road.<br />
&#8211; Vehicles emerging from side roads, parking places, or driveways.<br />
&#8211; Large vehicles crossing over to your side of the road.<br />
&#8211; Narrow roads where meeting other vehicles can be troublesome.<br />
&#8211; Loose pets and farmyard animals.<br />
&#8211; Changes in the traffic movement and volume because of temporary obstructions, such as broken down vehicles and road works.<br />
&#8211; Junctions and roundabouts.<br />
&#8211; Horse riders.<br />
&#8211; Adverse weather conditions.<br />
&#8211; Road surfaces.<br />
&#8211; Parked vehicles.</p>
<p>If you would check your mirror or brake when you see a potential hazard, this is a good indication that you should click the mouse.<br />
​<br />
You won&#8217;t be able to review your answers on this section of the theory test.<br />
The maximum score for the car and motorcycle theory test is 75 (i.e. 15 hazards x 5). The pass mark for this part of the test is 44 out of 75.<br />
Those taking LGV or PCV tests must score at least 67 out of 100 (i.e. 20 hazards x 5).</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ugh, the theory test. As if preparing for the <a title="How to pass your driving test" href="https://www.ingenie.com/young-drivers-guide/how-to-pass-your-driving-test-2/">practical driving test</a> wasn’t pressure enough, you’ll also need to pass the theory test before you can get your full driving licence. To help you achieve top marks, we’ve got 10 top tips for success.</p>
<h2>Be prepared:</h2>
<ol class="numbered-large">
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ol class="numbered-large">
<li>
<h3>Book your theory test</h3>
<p>It may sound obvious, but you’ll need to book your theory test at one of the 160 test centres nationwide. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-theory-test-centre" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visit the official government site</a> to find your nearest centre and book your test.</p>
<blockquote><p>Make sure you have your provisional licence and a credit or debit card to hand, because it’ll cost around £30.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Hit the books</h3>
<div class="row row-fluid">
<div class="col-10-12">
<p class="margin-right-20">During the theory test you’ll be given <strong>50 multiple choice questions</strong> from a bank of more than 1000 and you’ll need to get at least 43 correct to pass.</p>
<p class="margin-right-20">The good news is that the DVSA (Driving Standards Agency) has produced a theory test handbook which is packed full of useful tips and example questions. Make sure you get your hands on a copy and take some time to revise.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-2-12"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.ingenie.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/08/Hit-the-books-circle1.jpg" alt="Hit the books" width="300" height="300" /></div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Brush up on your hazard spotting</h3>
<p>Once you’ve made it through the multiple-choice questions you’ll move on to the hazard perception test. It’s made up of a series of video clips featuring a variety of driving hazards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right"><strong>Driving Standards Agency (DVSA)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Put in the hours</h3>
<p>Yep, when it comes to revising there’s just no substitute for putting the hours in. Your theory test questions will be picked at random, so you need to be confident answering ANY of the questions in the DSA Theory Test Handbook &#8211; that’s around 1000 possible questions!</p>
<p>And don’t forget to practise your hazard perception. You need to get <strong>a minimum of 43 out of 50</strong> on the multiple choice and <strong>44 out of 75</strong> on the hazard perception test to pass.</p>
<p>Practise answering under pressure by asking friends and family to quiz you, bearing in mind that in the real test you’ll have 57 minutes to answer the 50 questions.</li>
<li>
<h3>Take a mock test</h3>
<div class="row row-fluid">
<div class="col-10-12">
<p class="margin-right-20">Think you’re ready for your theory test? Head over to the government-run <a href="http://www.safedrivingforlife.info/practicetheorytest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safe Driving for Life website</a> and try their mock tests &#8211; though they only offer the multiple choice part.</p>
<p class="margin-right-20">If your mock test doesn’t go quite as well as you hoped, you can reschedule your theory test <strong>up to 3 days</strong> before your test date. If you’re not feeling confident of a pass, it’s best to take a rain check and squeeze in some extra revision!</p>

<h2 id="toc-0">Rules for learner drivers</h2>
<p>Before you start to drive or ride, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>hold a valid, provisional driving licence for Northern Ireland or Great Britain</li>
<li>make sure that any vehicle you drive is roadworthy and properly taxed and insured</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to learn safe driving practice from the beginning of your driving career because bad habits are hard to break. Experience has shown that learners who have a combination of professional training and private practice perform better during the driving test. Get together with your instructor and the person who will be helping you to practise and discuss what you need to focus on.</p>
<h2 id="toc-1">Safe driving habits</h2>
<p>Learning safe driving habits from the start will improve your safety and that of other road users. If you want to practise your driving with an accompanying driver, the accompanying driver must be over the age of 21 and, must hold a full licence in the relevant vehicle category for at least three years.</p>
<p>As a learner driver you must display &#8216;L&#8217; plates in a conspicuous position on the front and rear of your vehicle. These plates should be removed when the vehicle is not being driven by a learner, as the maximum speed limit for a vehicle displaying &#8216;L&#8217; plates is 45mph. This is irrespective of the driver being a learner or not (with the exception of goods vehicles, buses, and coaches on a motorway).</p>
<h2 id="toc-2">Minimum age you can take a test</h2>
<p>You can take your theory test once your provisional licence becomes valid. Normally, for car drivers, the earliest date your provisional licence can become valid is your 17th birthday. However you can apply for the licence up to two months before your 17th birthday.</p>
<p>So, if you apply for your provisional licence before you are 17, you will still have to wait until your 17th birthday before you can book your theory test.</p>
<h2 id="toc-3">Disability living allowance</h2>
<p>If you are receiving disability living allowance at the higher rate, you can apply for your provisional licence three months before your 16th birthday. The licence will only come into effect on your 16th birthday.</p>
<h2 id="toc-4">Mopeds and tractors</h2>
<p>If you want to ride a moped, you can take your theory test when you are 16, but again you must make sure you have a valid provisional licence. If you are 16 and already have a provisional licence for an agricultural vehicle or a moped, this will include provisional entitlement to drive a car but it only comes into effect when you are 17.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To be a safe driver, you need to know the rules of the road, and that’s where the driving theory test comes in.</p>
<p>The test is divided into two parts &#8211; multiple choice and hazard perception. Both tests are usually completed on a computer at the test station.</p>
<p>The multiple choice section consists of 50 questions, which you have 57 minutes to complete. You’ll need 43 or more correct answers to pass.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll then have the option of taking a short break before starting the hazard perception test.</p>
<p>This section involves watching 14 video clips which feature “everyday road scenes”, with at least one developing hazard.</p>
<p>TOP TIP &#8211; one of the clips will feature two developing hazards rather than one, so watch out for that one.</p>
<p>You need to click the mouse whenever you see a hazard developing. Each hazard carries a maximum score of five, and you’ll gain more points for spotting hazards earlier.</p>
<p>The pass mark for the hazard perception test is 44 of a possible 75.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is all about anticipation and reaction i.e. the earlier you see something the sooner you react to it. Make sure you look well ahead of you.</p>
<p>A hazard is anything that might make you change your speed or your direction. There are moving hazards and static hazards e.g. pedestrians, cyclists, speed bumps, potholes etc</p>
<p>Get as much driving experience as possible in all road, traffic and weather conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Some examples of good anticipation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Never take the actions of another road user for granted. Be prepared to stop even if you have right of way!<br />
Always look several cars ahead of you rather than at the car that’s directly in front. If you see brakes light ease of the gas while having a quick glance in your middle mirror and then apply the brakes if necessary.</li>
<li>When driving in traffic be wary of the vehicle in front is they are driving unusually slow, they may be looking for somewhere to pull in and park. Leave them plenty of room to manoeuvre. Often they may drive passed a parking spot, stop and reverse into the spot to park. Remember reverse lights are white so be ready to react if you see reverse lights coming on. You don’t want to stop to close and have to reverse yourself.</li>
<li>Watch out for your vulnerable road users i.e. pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. Pedestrians often walk in between vehicles (if raining they may be running) cyclists may swerve to avoid potholes / puddles.</li>
<li>Always leave enough room between you and the vehicle in front, make sure you have enough time to stop within the distance ahead of you that is clear.<br />
To summarise, you must “React promptly and properly to hazards” so as soon as you see a potential hazard ahead ease of the gas while checking your middle mirror, cover the brake and apply if necessary.</li>
</ul>
