What you need to learn&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;"},"content":{"rendered":"<div class=\"paragraph\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>About the Hazard Perception Test<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; The test consists of 14 video clips.<br \/>\n&#8211; It is the second part of the DVSA Theory Test. To pass the theory test, you must pass both sections (multiple choice and hazard perception) on the same test.<br \/>\n&#8211; Each clip is about one minute long.<br \/>\n&#8211; The hazard perception test will last for about twenty minutes.<br \/>\n&#8211; The clips show real life driving scenarios and are shot from a car as if from the driver&#8217;s point of view.<br \/>\n&#8211; There is at least one hazard in each clip. One clip has two hazards. You will not be told which clip has two hazards.<br \/>\n&#8211; A hazard is something that will cause the driver to react in a way that impedes their progress.<br \/>\n&#8211; When you identify the hazard on screen, you need to click the mouse. The earlier you identify the hazard, the more points you will score for your click. The timer counts down from five to zero points.<br \/>\n&#8211; Although you may click several times on a clip because you may believe there is more than one hazard, clicking continuously will result in you scoring zero.<br \/>\n&#8211; In a clip you may see several potential hazards. They only become a hazard if they would force the driver of the vehicle to change speed, direction or stop. These are the hazards you must click for.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Definition of A Hazard<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A hazard can be anything that causes a driver to change the speed, direction or stop the vehicle they are driving. Although in real life a hazard may be static such as a set of traffic lights, a junction or a bend, these are not the sorts of hazards that you will need to identify during the hazard perception test. During the hazard perception test you will need to identify hazards that develop and thus have motion such as a bus pulling away from a bus stop or a lollypop lady stepping into the road.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>Potential Hazards<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>These are situations that could lead to a hazard but haven&#8217;t impacted the driver in any way. If you click at this point, you won&#8217;t score any points.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>Developing Hazards<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is when the hazard seems like it will definitely affect the driver. This is when the scoring window opens and when you should click.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Actual Hazard<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is when the scoring window closes. The developing hazard is now a hazard and should have been identified prior to this stage.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>Passing the Hazard Perception Test<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>To pass the Hazard Perception Test, you must score a minimum of 44 out of 75 points.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div><\/div>\n<hr class=\"styled-hr\" \/>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">The Hazard Perception test forms the second section of the theory test. For cars and motorcycles, this test must be passed at the same time as the multiple choice part. For LGV and PCV theory tests (bus and lorry), they are taken as two separate tests. You must pass both.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">At the start of the hazard perception test, you will be shown a demonstration as to how the test works.<br \/>\nYou will then be shown 14 clips of everyday road scenes (19 for LGV and PCV). You will be asked to identify at least 1 developing hazard in each clip. One clip will have 2 developing hazards. This clip won&#8217;t be identified during the test.<\/p>\n<p>The DVSA describe a developing hazard as &#8216;something that may result in you having to take some action, such as changing speed or direction.&#8217; The earlier you spot the developing hazard, the higher your score will be.<\/p>\n<p>The maximum points you can score for each hazard is 5. It can be difficult to identify developing hazards, and therefore when the scoring window should start.\u00a0This is why it is safer to click a few times as you see a hazard develop. This way, you can be sure you do not click too early and miss the opening of the scoring window.<br \/>\n\u200b<br \/>\nIt is possible to score zero on a clip for clicking too much, or with a regular pattern. Don&#8217;t let this put you off, if you see what you believe to be a developing hazard, then click the button.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"wsite-image wsite-image-border-none \"><a href=\"https:\/\/test.1driver.co.uk\/hazard-preception-test\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/www.1driver.co.uk\/uploads\/3\/8\/6\/2\/3862120\/hazard-perception-mock-test-online_orig.png\" alt=\"hazard perception mock test online\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"wsite-spacer\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">Recognition of available clues and a perception of danger are the skills that are necessary\u00a0for all drivers and riders, irrespective of the vehicle used. For this reason, the same version of the hazard perception test is used for cars and motorcycles. LGV and PCV hazard perception tests consist of 19 clips and a higher pass mark.<\/p>\n<p><u>Look out for these hazards<\/u><br \/>\n&#8211; Hidden junctions and turns.<br \/>\n&#8211; Pedestrians or cyclists crossing the road.<br \/>\n&#8211; Vehicles emerging from side roads, parking places, or driveways.<br \/>\n&#8211; Large vehicles crossing over to your side of the road.<br \/>\n&#8211; Narrow roads where meeting other vehicles can be troublesome.<br \/>\n&#8211; Loose pets and farmyard animals.<br \/>\n&#8211; Changes in the traffic movement and volume because of temporary obstructions, such as broken down vehicles and road works.<br \/>\n&#8211; Junctions and roundabouts.<br \/>\n&#8211; Horse riders.<br \/>\n&#8211; Adverse weather conditions.<br \/>\n&#8211; Road surfaces.<br \/>\n&#8211; Parked vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>If you would check your mirror or brake when you see a potential hazard, this is a good indication that you should click the mouse.<br \/>\n\u200b<br \/>\nYou won&#8217;t be able to review your answers on this section of the theory test.<br \/>\nThe maximum score for the car and motorcycle theory test is 75 (i.e. 15 hazards x 5). The pass mark for this part of the test is 44 out of 75.<br \/>\nThose taking LGV or PCV tests must score at least 67 out of 100 (i.e. 20 hazards x 5).<\/p><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>About the Hazard Perception Test &#8211; The test consists of 14 video clips. &#8211; It is the second part of the DVSA Theory Test.
